## 🌟 What is ARIA?

**ARIA** (AI Reasoning & Interactive Assistant) is a cutting-edge AI teaching assistant specifically designed to transform how students learn **Statics & Mechanics of Materials**. Built with advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology, and powerful embedding tools, ARIA provides personalized, step-by-step guidance that adapts to each student's learning pace and style.

### 🎯 Why ARIA Was Built

Engineering education faces unique challenges:
- **Complex Problem-Solving**: Statics and mechanics require deep conceptual understanding
- **Individual Learning Pace**: Students need personalized guidance at their own speed
- **24/7 Availability**: Learning doesn't stop at classroom hours
- **Consistent Quality**: Every student deserves expert-level assistance

ARIA bridges these gaps by providing an intelligent, always-available teaching companion that understands both the subject matter and pedagogical best practices.
